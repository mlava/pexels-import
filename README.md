Embed an image from Pexels into your Roam Research graph.

You will need a free API key from https://www.pexels.com/api/new/

Configuration options include the orientation (landscape, portrait or square) and whether you prefer to embed the most recent curated image from the Pexxels team, or search for an image by keyword.

You can trigger this extension using the Command Palette (ctrl-p) and select 'Pexels embed'.
